                <div class="history-col">
                    <p>In the late 1800s, these dogs were brought to America for use as farm dogs, where a 
                    slightly larger version than its English counterpart was preferred. AmStaffs became 
                    extremely popular as family pets by the 1930s; one of the most beloved was Pete the
                    Pup (Petey) of Our Gang (The Little Rascals) fame. This American version eventually
                    was registered in 1936 as the Staffordshire terrier (changed in 1972 to the
                    American Staffordshire terrier). </p>
                    
                    <p>The American Staffordshire terrier is a bundle of muscles in an agile package.                        Every inch the athlete, this breed has remarkable strength. Despite its brawn, it is 
                    quick and nimble. The broad head with powerful jaws can be intimidating, but fortunately
                    the face usually bears a happy expression and is usually followed by a wagging tail that is
                    short, but not docked. Although the ears may be cropped, it is preferred that they be left
                    in their natural rose shape. This dog is heavy for its size, weighing in at about 45 to
                    70 pounds (20 to 32 kilograms). It stands between 17 and 19 inches tall. The coat is short
                    and sleek. Any color is acceptable, although a coat with more than 80 percent either 
                    white, black and tan, or liver are least preferred.</p>

                    <p>This breed needs a vigorous daily workout, along with some mind games, in order                         to be at its best. A good long run or a rollicking game of ball is a great way 
                     to bond with an American Staffordshire terrier. Obedience training is also good 
                     mental exercise.Its short coat makes it unsuited as an exclusively outdoor dog, 
                     and besides, this breed wants to be a part of all family activities. Coat care could not be easier: simply wash and wear.</p>
