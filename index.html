            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>The American Staffordshire Terrier is a loving, loyal, playful dog that loves to spend
                 time with human family members. They are quite muscular for their size, which can make 
                 them a handful on walks if they aren't trained properly. They also have strong jaws,
                  which they will use to chew out of boredom.</p>
